            Financial technology, also known as fin-tech, is an economic industry composed of companies that
            use technology to make financial services more efficient. Having grown from its initial use in
            the back-end systems of banks or other financial institutions, fintech now contributes in
            applications that are more consumer-focused. In the coming years, it would be possible to manage
            funds, trade stocks, pay for food or manage insurance through this technology. From Bitcoin to
            mobile banking, fintech has changed how consumers access their money.

        <p>
            Open innovation is the use of an organisationâ€™s internal knowledge and benefiting from external
            innovative solutions by collaborating with people and organisations outside the company. It
            helps to create new products and services with reduced costs, allowing organisations to stay
            ahead of the competition. Leading to better interactions between healthcare and other fields
            like big data and advanced materials, open innovation is the key to shape the future of
            diagnostics and imaging devices.
